### Technologies Used
* [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_)</br>
* [Object-Oriented design](https://stackabuse.com/object-oriented-design-principles-in-java)</br>
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)</br>
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)</br>
* [Unix Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)</br>
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)</br>

### Lessons Learned
* Differences between using MySQL and JPA for a data query.
* How to manipulate data using the JPA API.
* Better Object Oriented practices in regards to file structure and encapsulation.
* MVC design pattern using Spring Boot.
    * Model
    * View
    * Controller
* POST -> Redirect -> GET

### Usage
You can search a computer up by its Id. Once a computer is displayed, you can either choose to delete or edit the computer. In the home menu there is an option to create a computer.

### Further thoughts
As this project was my first time using Spring outside of a group setting, the learning experience was quite interesting.

Moving forward, I feel there is a need for exploring and learning ways to implement more defensive coding. The nature of databases in the real world, I feel,
necessitates robust built-in protections in the DAO.
